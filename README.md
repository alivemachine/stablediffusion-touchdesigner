# stablediffusion-touchdesigner-ui

Interface to use with [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). 
Simply install the stable diffusion web-ui, run webui.bat and run touchdesigner. Adjust errored nodes with your computer's paths.

This UI facilitates the creation of image sequences and manipulation of stable diffusion tools like text2img, img2img, inpainting, sketch, infinite zoom, masking, multi-controlnets, batch processing and such, so that the artist can focus on the images.
UI's most developed features are the timeline with adaptive framerate and stackable images (flipbook), the continuous inpainting using touchdesigner's multi-thread capability to process request in the background and generate frames as you keep painting, auto-masking using face-detection and keying, background image injection, wide input array (camera, browse, loopback...).
